<!--
  There are no extension fields, so there's really no reason for this file, except that in
  4.5, this config existed with is-extension="true" (mistakenly, I assume). As a result,
  nuxeo generated a tenant qualified doctype (ConservationTenant42), which was used as the
  primarytype of all conservation records in the hierarchy table. So now this has to be
  maintained going forward, for database compatibility.
